# Getting Started

This guide assumes that you have some familiarity with py4web, pydal, and yatl.  It is
not meant as an all-encompassing guide to using py4web, it is focused on the details 
of implementing grids into your applications.

The py4web manual shows how to install: 

[Installing from pip](https://py4web.com/_documentation/static/en/chapter-03.html#installing-from-pip)

or 

[Installing using a virtual environment](https://py4web.com/_documentation/static/en/chapter-03.html#installing-using-a-virtual-environment)

## Creating the Grid Tutorial Application

We will be creating a sample application that is based off the _scaffold app included in py4web.

- Locate the apps directory that you created in the install process (py4web setup apps)
- Inside the apps directory copy the _scaffold directory and all its contents to a new directory call grid_tutorial
- start up py4web with the `py4web run apps` command
- Point your browser to http://127.0.0.1:8000/grid_tutorial and you should see a very plain looking Hello page (we'll add style to this later)
