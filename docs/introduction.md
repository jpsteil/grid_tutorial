# Introduction

py4web is a rapid web application development tool developed by Massimo Di Pierro, the creator of web2py.
While the py4web grid is similar in function to the web2py SQLFORM.grid, it was written from the ground up 
and therefore doesn't share the same signature or features as the web2py SQLFORM.grid.

py4web grid is a pure HTML grid implementation with no javascript dependencies. Styling
is completely customizable with no.css (py4web css library) and Bulma support out of
the box.  A Bootstrap implementation is coming soon.

What follows in an exploration into the features of the py4web grid and examples showing
how to implement these features.
